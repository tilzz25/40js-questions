//29) What is event bubbling in JavaScript?

// Event bubbling is a mechanism in JavaScript where an event triggered on a specific element starts from that element and propagates upward through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy.
// This means that the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element (the one where the event occurred) and then propagated to its parent elements,
// and so on, up to the root of the document.
