//4)What are the differences between var, let, and const?

//Variables declared with var are hoisted, meaning they can be used before they are declared but he value will be undefined.

//It is not hoisted like var, so you cannot access it before declaration.

//The value assigned to a const variable cannot be reassigned,
// but the contents of objects or arrays declared with const can still be modified.
