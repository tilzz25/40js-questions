//14) What is the difference between logical operators && and ||?

// && (Logical AND):
// The && operator returns:
//The first falsy value it encounters, or
//The last value if all are truthy.

//|| (Logical OR):
// The || operator returns:
//The first truthy value it encounters, or
//The last value if all are falsy.
